## [0.1.13] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- `/about` now reports the host's LAN IP (via UDP socket route trick) and public IPv4 (via api.ipify.org) — both fall back to "unavailable" if unreachable.

## [0.1.12] - 2026-05-10

### Added
- `/about` command showing bot version, license, source URL, host name, OS, architecture, Python and yt-dlp versions, and process uptime.
- `/about` listed in `/help` together with the other utility commands.

## [0.1.11] - 2026-05-10

### Fixed
- Unlisted YouTube videos failing with "This video is not available". Added `_YOUTUBE_EXTRACTOR_ARGS` in `bot/downloader.py` that overrides yt-dlp's default `android_vr` player client with `mweb,web,android,ios`, applied to all four `ydl_opts` blocks (format detection, get_info, playlist extraction, download).

### Changed
- Bumped `yt-dlp` minimum to `>=2026.3.17` for upstream YouTube fixes.

## [0.1.10] - 2026-04-20

### Fixed
- YouTube `HTTP Error 403: Forbidden` caused by degraded POT tokens. The custom `pot-server` Dockerfile now installs `libexpat1`, which the native `canvas` module (used by `jsdom` for proof-of-origin attestation) requires.

### Changed
- Pinned `bgutil-ytdlp-pot-provider` to `>=1.3.1` to match the pot-server image and avoid version drift.

## [0.1.9] - 2024-01-19
